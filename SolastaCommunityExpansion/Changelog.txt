CHANGES:

- Add Merciless fighting style and feat
- Fix a TA issue with desyncs under certain smite scenarios
- Remove translation support for de, es, fr, it, pt and ru

TRANSLATIONS:

- It's a heavy toll to maintain languages with a subpar auto translation
- Please drop us a message on official Discord if you believe you can help 
- We need a solid commitment, about 1 hr a day to keep translations up to date
- Basic github knowledge is required to properly push changes
- Thanks @Nyowwww for not dropping the ball on Chinese
